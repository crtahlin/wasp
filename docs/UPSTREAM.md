# Bee-origin issues

Every wasp issue that also applies to upstream Bee, that is, one carrying the
`affects-upstream` label, which means the defect or gap was confirmed in
unmodified Bee code. This is the set a maintainer could one day offer upstream.

By the fork rules this file does not link to the Bee repository, and nothing here
authorises contacting Bee or opening anything there; the `affects-upstream`
label is a marker for a later human decision and nothing more. The issues and
commits below are wasp's own.

- **Status** is `done` when the change is merged on `main`, with the ledger's
  outcome added where it has one (`validated` measured on a real node,
  `neutral` no measurable effect). A `done` row carrying neither word is merged
  but not yet measured, so the issue itself can still be open. `open` means no
  wasp change has merged for it yet. `not planned` means the issue was closed
  without a wasp change. `(via #N)` or `(bundled with #N)` means the fix
  landed inside another issue's pull request.
- **Branch** is the fork branch the work was built on. Fork branches are never
  deleted, so each one still exists. A dash means the issue has no branch of its
  own: the fix shared another issue's branch, the issue is still open, or no
  wasp change was made.
- **Commit** links the merge commit on `main`. A dash means no wasp change has
  merged.
- **Title** follows the issue's own title, with punctuation normalized to ASCII
  under the writing rules. Some older issue titles contain em-dashes; those read
  as commas here. This reverses an earlier instruction not to edit titles in
  this column at all, which was written to stop a title being reworded into
  something its author did not write; replacing a punctuation mark with its
  ASCII equivalent is not rewording. The wording is otherwise unchanged, so a
  title still identifies its issue. Do not reword a title to improve it: the
  column's job is to find the issue.

Derived from the experiment ledger ([`experiments/INDEX.md`](experiments/INDEX.md))
and the git history on 2026-09-17, against the upstream base
`v2.8.2`. Two issues (#73, #76) were closed not planned. Wasp issue numbers can
collide with upstream Bee pull-request numbers in the shared history, so the
commits here were resolved from fork-only merges, not by issue number alone.

#301 and #302 are done, and they settle only half of what #300 says. Its per
peer half stands: the three chain calls were confirmed directly, and the rate at
which one peer can serve another was measured in #290. Its node-wide half, the
cost across all of a node's peers at once, was never exercised, so #300 stays
open and the work needed to answer it is
[#312](https://github.com/crtahlin/wasp/issues/312). A reader should not take
the two closed rows as evidence for that half.

#303 and #304 had rows here and no longer do. Both lost the
`affects-upstream` label when their spec was written
(`docs/experiments/accounting-gates/spec.md`, Upstream portability). They are
optimizations this fork wants, not things upstream got wrong, and rule 11 says
to tag defects rather than preferences. The same reading of that code did turn
up two genuine problems, and they were split off rather than left attached to
the changes:

- [#316](https://github.com/crtahlin/wasp/issues/316) is tagged and has its row
  above, but **not for the reason first recorded here, which was wrong and is
  corrected per rule 11.**

  This entry said the defect was the missing cap in `settle`, and called it
  rule 11's own example, one quantity computed two different ways. It is not.
  `peerAllowance` grants elapsed seconds times the refresh rate, and
  `NotifyRefreshmentSent` blocklists a peer that forgives less than
  `interval x refreshRate`, so both sides of the protocol agree a refreshment
  is worth the elapsed product. Capping `settle`'s prediction at one rate would
  make this node pay for debt its peer is obliged to forgive. The capped sites
  bound a credit limit until the next refreshment; two of them are not gates at
  all but the read-only reporter in `PeerAccounting`. They share a name with
  this one and nothing else.

  What is upstream's defect, and what keeps the label, is that the elapsed time
  is a signed subtraction with no clamp, so a clock stepping back a second or
  more makes the term negative and raises the payment. Upstream line 484 is
  unclamped. That is the same fault #359 fixed on the credit-limit side, and
  the fix is the same change in both trees.
- [#333](https://github.com/crtahlin/wasp/issues/333), the growth checkpoint
  rewound on connect while `totalDebtRepay` is not, is tagged and has its row
  above. `Connect` sets `thresholdGrowAt` back to 450,000,000 but nothing ever
  re-zeroes the cumulative figure it is tested against, which is written once at
  record creation, and the per-peer record is never deleted from the map. So a
  returning peer with a long history fires the threshold upgrade on every
  settlement until the checkpoint climbs back over the stale total, sending an
  announce under the peer lock each time.

  **Two statements here were wrong and are corrected, per rule 11.** The first
  said the run raises the granted threshold "past a limit the node refuses to
  start with". It does not, at the shipped default: a peer at 10,000,000,000
  collects 18 upgrades worth 81,000,000, and 13,500,000 + 81,000,000 =
  94,500,000, below the 108,000,000 `maxPaymentThreshold`. It passes that limit
  only for a configured base above 27,000,000. The second said the area was
  "verified byte-identical to `upstream/v2.8.2` across `pkg/accounting`,
  `pkg/pricing` and `pkg/settlement/pseudosettle`". That is no longer true:
  `git diff --stat upstream/v2.8.2 origin/main` over those three paths reports
  11 files changed and 2,203 lines inserted. The defect is still upstream's, but
  that had to be checked in upstream's own copy rather than by diffing the
  files: `totalDebtRepay` is written zero once at line 613 there and every other
  write is an addition, and upstream's `Connect` carries the same reset block,
  lines 1425 to 1433, with the same omission.

  It was read from the code and not measured on a node.
- [#317](https://github.com/crtahlin/wasp/issues/317), the unlocked allocation
  in `chequebook.Issue`, is **not** tagged and has no row. The code is the same
  upstream, but no caller there or here can reach it: `Issue` has a single
  caller, gated per peer by `paymentOngoing`, and two peers cannot share a
  beneficiary. It is a latent hazard that #303 itself would make reachable, and
  rule 11 says to leave untagged what is reasoned from reading the code rather
  than reproduced. That issue records what evidence would justify the tag later.
